    Bella the Chihuahua
</h1>

<p>
    Bella is not a normal Chihuahua she's a cool Chihuahua with an adventurous spirit and athletic build.
    She's often found running ahead on trails and being mistaken for a cat. 
</p>
<p>
    While most small dogs are not see as majestic- this sophisticated pup stands tall and proud of her claimed territory.
